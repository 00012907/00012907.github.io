The Website “Floral.uz” is created to promote a local floral shop in Tashkent. Overall, the website has 6 fully responsive pages with consistent design: “Homepage”, “About Us”, “Our Services”, “Products”, “Pricing” and “Contact Us”.

 No website templates and designs were not used, everything (tables/carousels/JS form validation and responsiveness functions) is written from scratch except a Carousel CSS code (‘Codepan.io’) in the “About Us” section only. 

Images and videos do not represent the actual brand but are taken from ‘pexels.com’ and texts are made up, however, titles and pictures are relevant to the topic of the website. The pages contain links to external resources and visual effects on CSS.
Semantic design is used with proper tags such as section/article/table/figure/figcaption/form/label/header/footer/main. Figure and figcaption are used with images. 

Webpage content is animated made with the use of ‘transform/transition’ properties and made responsive with the ‘media’ property.
Javascript is utilized to make a responsive hamburger navbar, and carousels (in “Homepage” and “About Us” sections, interactive form validations in “Homepage”, “Contact Us”, and “Products” sections, and dynamically generate DOM elements (in “Products” section). 
The website codes are validated in https://validator.w3.org &
https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator  sites, and no severe errors were found.
